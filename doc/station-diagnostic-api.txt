Station Diagnostic hierarchy [experimental]
============================

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.StationDiagnostic
Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Methods		dict GetDiagnostics()

			Get all diagnostic information for this interface. The
			diagnostics are contained in a single dictionary. Values
			here are generally low level and not meant for general
			purpose applications which could get by with the
			existing Station interface or values which are volatile
			and change too frequently to be represented as
			properties. The values in the dictionary may come and
			go depending on the state of IWD.

			Below is a list of possible diagnostic dictionary
			values:

			ConnectedBss - MAC address of currently connected BSS.

			Frequency - Frequency of currently connected BSS.

			Security - The chosen security for the connection.

			RSSI [optional] - The RSSI of the currently connected BSS.

			AverageRSSI [optional] - Average RSSI of currently connected BSS.

			RxMode [optional] -	The phy technology being used
						(802.11n, 802.11ac or 802.11ax).

			RxRate [optional] - Receive rate in 100kbit/s

			RxMCS [optional] - Receiving MCS index

			TxMode [optional] -	Same meaning as RxMode, just for
						transmission.

			TxRate [optional] - Transmission rate in 100kbit/s

			TxMCS [optional] - Transmitting MCS index

			PairwiseCipher [optional] - The pairwise cipher chosen
				for this connection. Possible values are:
					- CCMP-128
					- TKIP
					- GCMP-128

			Possible errors: net.connman.iwd.Busy
					 net.connman.iwd.Failed
					 net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
