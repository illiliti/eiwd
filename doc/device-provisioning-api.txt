Device Provisioning hierarchy
=============================

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.DeviceProvisioning [Experimental]
Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Methods		string StartEnrollee()

			Start a DPP enrollee. Currently only station devices are
			supported.

			Returns the enrollees URI

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments
						net.connman.iwd.AlreadyExists
						net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable

		void Stop()

			Stop an enrollee or configurator that is running.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotFound

		string StartConfigurator()

			Start a DPP configurator. Currently only connected
			station devices are supported, and will only configure
			the enrollee to the currently connected network.

			Returns the configurator URI

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
						net.connman.iwd.NotSupported
						net.connman.iwd.Busy

		string ConfigureEnrollee(string uri)

			Start a DPP configurator with an enrollees URI.
			Only connected station devices are supported and will
			only configure the enrollee to the currently connected
			network.

			This API is to handle the use case where the enrollee
			has shared its URI to IWD (unlike StartConfigurator)

			The URI for IWD is also returned which could be used
			in the same way as it is with StartConfigurator().

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotAvailable
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
						net.connman.iwd.NotSupported
						net.connman.iwd.Busy

Properties	boolean Started [readonly]

			True if DPP is currently active.

		string Role [readonly, optional]

			Indicates the DPP role. Possible values are "enrollee"
			or "configurator". This property is only available when
			Started is true.

		string URI [readonly, optional]

			Indicates the DPP URI. This property is only available
			when Started is true.


Interface	net.connman.iwd.SharedCodeDeviceProvisioning [Experimental]
Object path	/net/connman/iwd/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

		void ConfigureEnrollee(a{sv})

			Starts a DPP configurator using a shared code (and
			optionally identifier) set in the dictionary argument.
			Valid dictionary keys are:

			string Code
				The shared code to use. The code used by both
				parties (configurator and enrollee) must match.

			string Identifier
				An optional identifier. The identifier used by
				both parties must match. Per the DPP spec the
				identifier "shall be a UTF-8 string not greater
				than eighty (80) octets"

			As with the DeviceProvisioning interface, configurators
			must be connected to the network they wish to configure
			in order to start.

			Once started a configurator (acting as a responder) will
			listen on the currently connected channel for an
			enrollee's initial exchange request which will kick off
			the shared code bootstrapping protocol (PKEX). Once
			completed DPP will start automatically. Only one
			enrollee can be configured per call to
			ConfigureEnrollee, i.e. once PKEX/DPP has finished
			(including failure) the configurator will stop.

			The SharedCode methods have an eventual timeout and will
			stop automatically after 2 minutes.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.Busy
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.InvalidArguments

		void StartEnrollee(a{sv})

			Starts a DPP enrollee using a shared code (and
			optionally identifier) set in the dictionary argument
			(described above in ConfigureEnrollee).

			As with the device provisioning interface, enrollees
			must be disconnected in order to start.

			Once started an enrollee (acting as an initiator) will
			iterate channels sending out broadcast exchange requests
			waiting for a response from a configurator. A response
			will kick off the shared code bootstrapping protocol
			(PKEX), followed by DPP if successful. Once the
			protocols have completed, or failed, the enrollee will
			stop. If failed, StartEnrollee will need to be called
			again to retry.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.Busy
						net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments

		void StartConfigurator(object agent_path)

			Start a shared code configurator using an agent
			(distingushed by 'agent_path') to obtain the shared
			code. This method is meant for an automated use case
			where a configurator is capable of configuring multiple
			enrollees, and distinguishing between them by their
			identifier.

			If the agent service disappears during the shared code
			exchange it will be stopped, and the protocol will fail.

			This method behaves nearly the same as ConfigureEnrollee
			except upon receiving an enrollees first exchange
			request the registered agent will be asked for the
			shared code using the RequestSharedCode method.

			Though the agent can provide shared codes for multiple
			enrollees, this method will only configure a single
			enrollee at a time. Once completed it will need to be
			called again to configure additional enrollees.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.Busy
						net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
						net.connman.iwd.NoAgent

		Stop()

			Stop a currently running configurator/enrollee. Note
			that this will also interrupt DPP if the protocol has
			advanced that far. Since DPP is initiated implicitly
			from the shared code APIs it will also be canceled.
			Calling Stop() if DPP was started via the
			DeviceProvisioning interface will not stop it.

			Possible errors:	net.connman.iwd.NotFound

Properties	boolean Started [readonly]

			True if shared code device provisioning is currently
			active. (configurator or enrollee is started)

		string Role [readonly, optional]

			Indicates the DPP role. Possible values are "enrollee"
			or "configurator". This property is only available when
			Started is true.

SharedCodeAgent hierarchy
=========================

Service		unique name
Interface	net.connman.iwd.SharedCodeAgent [Experimental]
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release() [noreply]

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			unregisters the agent.

		string RequestSharedCode(string identifier)

			This method gets called when a shared code is requested
			for a particular enrollee, distingushed by the
			identifier. The shared code agent should lookup the
			identifier and return the shared code, or return an
			error if not found.

			Possible Errors:	[service].Error.Canceled
						[service].Error.NotFound

		void Cancel(string reason) [noreply]

			This method gets called to indicate that the agent
			request failed before a reply was returned. The
			argument will indicate why the request is being
			cancelled and may be "user-canceled", "timed-out" or
			"shutdown".

Examples	Requesting a shared code for an enrollee identified by "foo"

			RequestSharedCode("foo") ==> "super_secret_code"
